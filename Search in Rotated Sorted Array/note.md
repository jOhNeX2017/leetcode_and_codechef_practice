# Intuition
First I have to find the kth index from where the array is rotated, then find the mid index of the rotated array
And then after that we do the binary search, and also if the right part or left part is divided. Then, we have to divide it into sub parts & do the  binary search in sub parts.


# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(log(n))$$

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
